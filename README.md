# Library-management-system
using MySql we are going to build a project based on Library Management System. It keeps track of all information about books in the library, their cost, status and total number of books available in the library.
# Tables Used.

Created a database named library and following TABLES in the database:

1. Branch
2. Employee
3. Books
4. Customer
5. IssueStatus
6. ReturnStatus
7. 
# Screenshots

uploaded the screenshots of data that retrive while this sql codes were runned

# Use of this

from this we can easily get the information of library and the books that are available now and the books taken by the customers from the library returned books. it will automatically changes the status of books available in the libray when the customer took that book and when the customer return the books.
